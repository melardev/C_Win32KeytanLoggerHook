# Introduction
This is a basic Win32 Keylogger written in C. It uses Win32 API as much as I could for everything.
It records the keys entered using the SetWindowsHookEx method, it buffers the keys to reduce IO Operations,
then it only writes into disk after a threshold of chars are recorded in memory.
**Meant for educational purposes only!**

# TODO
- Uppercase logging.
- Better key modifiers logging
